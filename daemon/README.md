# Daemon

This is the the program that listens to the input (usually a microphone), transcribes the audio and sends it to the API to be translated and broadcasted to the client browsers.

## Virtual Environment

We have created a virtual environment to help you to contain the daemon's dependencies.

```sh
source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
